  Redirections in this file will not be reported. Usually they are redirecting
  from a versionless URL to a versioned URL.
  Note that redirections from the site root to a subpage is always allowed.
  Each line has two URLs, separated by a tab. The second URL can use $n to refer
  to capture groups in the first URL.
  Use two-space indent for comments. Use {...} to embed regex.
